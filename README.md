# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
After helping Seth and Tom with the election audit results which they submitted to the election commission, the commission made some additional requests:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
With the code that was already creaeted we were able to refactor the code so that we could get the information requested.

## Election-Audit Results
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
