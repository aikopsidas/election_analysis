# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
After helping Seth and Tom with the election audit results which they submitted to the election commission, the commission made some additional requests:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout
With the code that was already created we were able to refactor the code so that we could get the information requested.

## Election-Audit Results
### The following results were created with the PyPoll_Challenge Python Code
- Total votes that were cast in this congressional election:
  - **369,711**
- Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct:
  - **Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)**

## Election-Audit Summary
This python code is fantastic because it can be used to review any election results with a few minor adjustments to the coded.
Below are a couple of screen shots showing what sections would need some updating
- This section of the code can be updated to retrieve any .csv file to run through the script


- Depending on which columns hold the data to be used in the script, the below items many need to be updated
